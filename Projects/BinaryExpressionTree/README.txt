postfix.cpp

This program takes any postfix expression as input and
outputs the evaluated answer along with the steps it takes
to calculate the answer. Available operators include:
~ +
~ -
~ *
~ /
~ %
and you may use multiple digit signed numbers as operands.

myBet.cpp

This program reads from the 'infix.dat' file which contains an
unknown amount of infix expressions, each one on a new line. After
reading in the expression, it is converted into a postfix expression
and saved as a string. Then it is converted into a Binary Expression
Tree (BET) where a preorder traversal is performed. This traversal is
the output of the program.
